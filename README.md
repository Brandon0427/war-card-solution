# War Card Game

## Description

War is a classic card game played between two players using a standard deck of 52 cards. To begin, the deck is shuffled and divided evenly between the players, with each player receiving half of the deck face down.

Players simultaneously reveal the top card from their decks. The player with the higher-ranking card wins the round and collects both cards, placing them face down at the bottom of their stack. If there is a tie, it's a "war."

During a war, each player places three cards face down, followed by one face-up card. The player with the higher-ranking face-up card wins all the cards in the war and adds them to their stack.

The game continues until one player has no remaining cards to reveal, which makes it the lose the game.

## Additional Considerations

- Deck of cards of each player can be predetermined.
- Deck of does not need to be of 52 cards.
- Card suits should not be taken into consideration.
- Card argument types could just be given with numbers.
- When a 'war' begins, if a player can't reveal 3 cards at once, automatically makes it the loser.
